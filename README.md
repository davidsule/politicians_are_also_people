## To-dos
- Find Literature regarding previous work
- Find existing types of models - types, improvements, proposals.

## Brain Storm Questions
 - which models are suited for cross-domain? 
 - What can be Improved in current methods?
 - How to make a baseline model? (Trained seperately per domain?)
 - How to handle labels in cross-domain?
 - What are we actually even trying to classify?

### RC Project Proposal 3
Can we SOMEHOW find a way to represent different entity types in different domains (i.e. use entity types from Reuters / Literature in the Music Domain) in the same subset of labels? 

How do we Build Hierarchy of labels, that can represent entities and their relations across domains? 

We want to PREDICT the label from a *specific subset* by some method, that still maintains the structure and meaning of extracted relations. That still remains well-performing, and thus is generalizable.
